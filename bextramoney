So, this is a new(old-ish) venture I have started. Reddit concept called beermoney which basically means extra money on the side. 

March 2021 officially started "working" on uhrs cw. 1st week itself got massive inferiority complex. 
Apparently people were earning $100 in two days on uhrs tasks. $100 in 2 days -- I mean that is full-time job salary I was
getting in Houston, Texas. because $9/hr for 8 hours a day = 56*2 = 112 in 2 days. 
This $112 was after standing in the damned store for 8 hours straight, dealing with all sorts of bitchass niggas and of course 
going to the store and coming back, in the useless METRO bus.
Ani ithe chayla loka India madhe basun $100 milvatat? ghari basun? only through laptop and internet access??? 
shocking. shocking. shocking. 
INSUBORDIATE AND CHURLISH! RIDICULOUS AND UNACCEPTABLE AA-ROON!
